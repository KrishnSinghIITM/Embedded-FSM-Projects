# ESP32 Traffic Light Controller

A simple and effective Finite State Machine (FSM) for controlling a traffic light, built for the ESP32.

## üö¶ Features

* **Automatic Cycle:** The traffic light automatically cycles through Red, Green, and Yellow states using non-blocking timers.

* **Pedestrian Sensor:** A push button acts as a pedestrian sensor, allowing the Green light state to be interrupted for a faster cycle.

* **State-Based Logic:** Clean, readable, and efficient code built around a classic Finite State Machine pattern.

* **Wokwi Ready:** Includes a `diagram.json` for instant simulation.

## üìÇ File Structure

* `README.md`: This documentation file.

* `src/`: Contains the main source code (`sketch.ino`) for the ESP32.

* `doc/`: Contains supporting documentation and diagrams, including the `diagram.json` for Wokwi.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The controller is built as a **Finite State Machine** with three states:

1. `STATE_RED`

2. `STATE_GREEN`

3. `STATE_YELLOW`

The system uses the `millis()` function to manage time without freezing the code with `delay()`. This allows the controller to be responsive to button presses at all times. The state transitions are triggered by either a timer expiring or a pedestrian request (button press) during the green light.
